function y = ApplyDVR3D(Tx,Ty,Tz,V,x)
%Apply the sparse 3D DVR Hamiltonian to a state x in vectorized format and return in state y
%This routine is used as the matrix-vector multiply operation within eigs
%

Nx=size(Tx,1); Ny=size(Ty,1); Nz=size(Tz,1);
%Unpack state from vectorized to tensor format
xr=reshape(x,[Nx,Ny,Nz]);
%Apply (diagonal) V operator
y=V.*xr;
%Kinetic energy operators, e.g., T_x, are sparse in the sense that they have the form T_x\otimes I_y\otimes I_z
%This means that they can be applied in O(N_x^2 N_y N_z) time
%Here, we account for this sparsity by reshaping the 3-tensor \psi into a matrix and using fast matrix-matrix multiplies
%Tx
y=y+reshape(Tx*reshape(xr,[Nx,Ny*Nz]),[Nx,Ny,Nz]);
%Ty
y=y+permute(reshape(Ty*reshape(permute(xr,[2,1,3]),Ny,Nx*Nz),Ny,Nx,Nz),[2,1,3]);
%Tz
y=y+permute(reshape(Tz*reshape(permute(xr,[3,1,2]),Nz,Nx*Ny),Nz,Nx,Ny),[2,3,1]);
%put output state in vectorized format
y=reshape(y,[Nx*Ny*Nz,1]);
