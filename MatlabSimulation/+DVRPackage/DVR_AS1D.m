function [vecs,vals] = DVR_AS1D(vals,BareScal,Nbands,potential)
%Set up and diagonalize the DVR representation of a 1D problem with potential given by potential(x).
%vals is a vector of gridpoints, BareScal is the coefficient of the (d^2/dx^2) operator, and Nbands are the number of eigenstates desired.
%This routine does not use parity symmetry.
